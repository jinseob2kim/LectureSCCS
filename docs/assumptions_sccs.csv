Problems	Solutions	Examples
Event temporarily decreases probability of exposure	Include a pre-exposure period	Stowe et al studied the risk of infections after mumps, measles, and rubella vaccination. Vaccination is delayed when a child has an infection; a 14 day pre-exposure period was included to allow for this
Event temporarily increases probability of exposure	Include a pre-exposure period	Gibson et al studied the association between prescription drugs and motor vehicle crashes. A four week pre-exposure period was included as some drugs may be used to treat anxiety or pain caused by the crash
No exposure can occur (or is observed) after event	For single exposures that cannot be repeated, begin observation period at exposure, so only exposed cases are included. End observation at planned end	Hubbard et al studied the association between first bupropion prescription and sudden death. The observation period began with date of first prescription and ended (beyond death) with date of last data collection for the cohort. At the time, bupropion could only be prescribed as a single course of treatment
	For single or multiple exposures, use method outlined in Farrington et al	Dodd et al studied the association between influenza vaccination and Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS). Some practitioners will not vaccinate patients with previous GBS.10 Various analyses were performed: standard SCCS, vaccinated cases only, and the method outlined in Farrington et al
Event increases probability of death	Undertake suitable tests or sensitivity analyses excluding cases who died as a result of event	Langan et al studied the risk of stroke after herpes zoster infection. A sensitivity analysis was performed excluding cases who died within 90 days of stroke. Findings were not modified
	If necessary, use methods outlined in Farrington et al to adjust for bias	Brauer et al studied the association between antipsychotic drugs and myocardial infarction using both methods outlined in Farrington et al12 and a standard SCCS analysis. There was little difference in results
Recurrences of an event are not independent	Study first event only	Recurrence of stroke is not independent of the first occurrence, so only a first stroke event can be studied. In a study on the risk of stroke, Langan et al began the observation period 12 months into follow-up time to ensure first stroke events had been correctly identified11
